        <p>This page is to showcase my work for Web Design class at Connecticut State Community College.
            My name is Laura and I am a graphic design student. I am a Brazilian-American who loves books,
            which is why I chose the image above, showcasing the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading found
            in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My career goal is to be a book cover designer for a publishing house.
            I have always loved reading, and my favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. In my free
            time, I love to crochet, rebind books, and read. I have rebound several books including the Percy Jackson
            series, the original Red Rising Trilogy, Where the Crawdads Sing, and more. I have also crocheted
            several articles of clothing, and read over a thousand books. I am also a singer, participated in several
            musicals; including Beauty and the Beast as Mrs. Potts and Bye-Bye Birdie as Mae Peterson; and performed
            at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a teenager.</p>
